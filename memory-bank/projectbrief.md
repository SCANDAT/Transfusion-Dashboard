# Project Brief: Transfusion Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Transfusion Dashboard is a web-based visualization tool for analyzing and displaying blood transfusion data in ICU settings. The dashboard visualizes time-series data after blood transfusion, showing how different donor and blood component factors affect vital parameter trajectories in ICU patients.

## Core Requirements

1. **Data Visualization**: Provide interactive charts and visualizations of blood transfusion data
2. **Multiple Analysis Views**: Support different visualization perspectives including:
   - Descriptive statistics of transfused patients and blood components
   - RBC transfusion impact on vital parameters
   - RBC component factors and their effects

3. **User Interface**: Implement a modern, accessible interface following the established design system
4. **Data Processing**: Handle multiple CSV formats efficiently and reliably
5. **Extensibility**: Support adding new visualizations and data types in the future

## Target Users

- Medical researchers studying blood transfusion effects
- ICU clinicians analyzing patient data
- Healthcare data analysts working with transfusion datasets

## Key Features

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Visual representation of patient demographics and blood component characteristics
2. **Component Factors Visualization**: Analysis of how donor and storage factors influence patient outcomes
3. **Transfusion Visualization**: Multi-parameter selection interface showing transfusion effects with paired standard and LOESS plots
4. **Comparison Tools**: Ability to filter and compare different factors and parameters
5. **Time Range Controls**: Adjustable time windows for data visualization
6. **Export Capability**: SVG export for publication-ready visualizations

## Success Criteria

1. Intuitive interface that requires minimal training to use
2. Accurate visualization of complex transfusion data
3. Responsive performance with larger datasets
4. Support for multiple browsers and screen sizes
5. Clear visual distinction between different data categories
6. High-quality visualization output suitable for research publications

## Constraints

1. Browser-based implementation (no server-side processing)
2. CSV as the primary data source format
3. Support for modern browsers only (ES6+ compatibility)
