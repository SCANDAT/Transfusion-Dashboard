## Lessons Learned

### Theme Implementation
- âœ… Chart.js configurations are duplicated across multiple modules (visualization.js, transfusions.js) 
- âœ… Theme-aware code must be updated in all relevant locations
- âœ… Using consistent dark backgrounds with light text for tooltips improves readability in both themes
- âœ… Testing both dark and light mode is essential for each feature
- âœ… Toggle testing helps identify transition issues that might not be apparent in static states

### Code Structure
- âœ… Identifying duplicate functionality across modules helps avoid inconsistencies
- âœ… Chart.js configuration for tooltips should follow consistent patterns
- âœ… Consider refactoring common chart configurations into shared functions

## Known Issues

Based on observations and recent work, the following issues have been identified or addressed:

1. **Data Processing**
   - Potential performance challenges with larger datasets
   - Edge cases in CSV formatting and structure
   - Browser compatibility considerations

2. **Visualization**
   - âœ… Low contrast in dark mode charts (RESOLVED)
   - âœ… Illegible tooltips in light mode (RESOLVED)
   - Chart rendering optimizations for complex datasets
   - SVG export quality and compatibility
   - Responsive behavior on various screen sizes

3. **User Interface**
   - âœ… Theme toggle inconsistencies in tooltips (RESOLVED)
   - Theme switching edge cases in other components
   - Responsive layout on smaller screens
   - Advanced filter combinations

## Next Milestones

Based on the project architecture and its current state, logical next milestones would include:

1. **Theme System Refinement**
