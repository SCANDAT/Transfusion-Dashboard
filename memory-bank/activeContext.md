# Active Context: Transfusion Dashboard

## Current Focus

The Transfusion Dashboard project appears to be in active development with a focus on creating a comprehensive visualization system for blood transfusion data in ICU settings. Based on the project architecture and design system documentation, the current focus appears to be on:

1. **Modular Implementation**: Developing the core modules (dashboard controller, visualization, component factors, transfusions) with clear separation of concerns
2. **Data Visualization Pipeline**: Establishing robust data loading, transformation, and visualization workflows
3. **UI Implementation**: Applying the premium design system to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial memory bank setup, specific recent changes are not documented. The project appears to be established with key architecture and design decisions in place, including:

- Defined modular structure with clear responsibilities
- Comprehensive design system with dark/light theme support
- Data loading and visualization patterns

## Active Decisions

Several key technical and design decisions are guiding current development:

1. **Client-Side Processing**: All data transformation and visualization happens in the browser, with no server-side processing
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between dashboard control, data loading, and visualization components
3. **Premium Design System**: Modern, accessible interface with dark/light theme support
4. **CSV as Data Source**: Standardized data format with specific naming conventions and structure

## Next Steps

Based on the project documentation, logical next steps appear to be:

1. **Visualization Refinement**: Enhancing chart capabilities and interactivity
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient data processing for larger datasets
3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Robust handling of edge cases in data loading and processing
4. **Export Functionality**: Implementing high-quality SVG export for research publications
5. **Responsive Design Implementation**: Ensuring proper function across different device sizes
6. **User Testing**: Validating the interface with target users (medical researchers, ICU clinicians)

## Open Questions

As I begin working with this project, several questions will need clarification:

1. What is the current development priority among the different modules?
2. Are there specific visualization features that need enhancement?
3. What is the current testing approach for the application?
4. Are there known issues or limitations in the current implementation?
5. What are the deployment plans for the dashboard?

## Development Approach

The development approach appears to follow these principles:

1. **Modular Implementation**: Each functional area is developed as a separate module
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, with advanced features added incrementally
3. **Design System Compliance**: UI elements follow the established design system
4. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling for data loading and processing
5. **Scientific Accuracy**: Visualizations prioritize accuracy and clarity for medical research

As I work with this project, this active context will be updated to reflect the evolving focus, recent changes, and emerging priorities.
