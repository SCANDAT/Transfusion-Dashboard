# Active Context: Transfusion Dashboard

## Current Focus

The Transfusion Dashboard project is in active development with a focus on creating a comprehensive visualization system for blood transfusion data in ICU settings. Based on the project architecture and design system documentation, the current focus areas are:

1. **Modular Implementation**: Developing the core modules (dashboard controller, visualization, component factors, transfusions) with clear separation of concerns
2. **Data Visualization Pipeline**: Establishing robust data loading, transformation, and visualization workflows
3. **UI Implementation**: Applying the premium design system to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface
4. **Theme Consistency**: Ensuring all UI components work correctly in both dark and light modes

## Recent Changes

### Vital Parameter Display Fix

- **Fixed Parameter Abbreviation Display**: Resolved an issue where vital parameter abbreviations were not displaying correctly:
  - Charts in the Main Findings tab were showing "Change in undefined (mmHg)" instead of "Change in MAP (mmHg)"
  - The root cause was an inconsistency between the `getParameterDetails` function implementations:
    - In `componentFactors.js`: The function returned `{ name, unit, abbr }` properties
    - In `mainFindings.js`: The function only returned `{ name, unit }` properties (missing the crucial `abbr` property)
  - Fixed by updating the `mainFindings.js` implementation to include the proper `abbr` property with appropriate mappings
  - This resolved all instances of "undefined" showing in place of parameter abbreviations

### UI Navigation Update

- **Tab Order Modification**: Rearranged the dashboard tabs to place "Descriptive Statistics" at the end:
  - Changed tab order from: Main Findings → Descriptive Statistics → RBC Transfusion Effects → Component Factor Effects
  - To new order: Main Findings → RBC Transfusion Effects → Component Factor Effects → Descriptive Statistics
  - This change provides a more logical flow from main findings to detailed analysis modules

### Theme Toggle and UI Improvements

- **Tooltip Styling Fix**: Resolved inconsistent tooltip appearance across:
  - Fixed tooltip background color in light mode from transparent to dark blue-gray 
  - Standardized white text in tooltips for both modes
  - Added consistent borders and shadow for better definition
  - Identified and fixed duplicate tooltip configurations in multiple JavaScript modules

- **Code Duplication Awareness**: Discovered that Chart.js configurations are duplicated across:
  - visualization.js (used by Component Factors tab)
  - transfusions.js (used by RBC Transfusion Effects tab)
  - These duplications require coordinated updates when fixing theme-related issues

- **Enhanced Chart Visibility**: Improved contrast and readability of all chart elements in dark mode by:
  - Increasing brightness of chart lines and areas
  - Implementing thicker lines in dark mode (3px vs 2px in light mode)
  - Enhancing grid line visibility with increased opacity (15% vs 5%)
  - Making axis labels, tick values, and legends more readable
  - Ensuring consistent styling across all chart types

- **Theme-Aware Conditional Styling**: Implemented checks for dark/light theme to dynamically adjust:
  - Color brightness
  - Line thickness
  - Fill opacity
  - Text contrast

- **Standardized Improvements**: Applied consistent styling across all visualization components:
  - Main visualization charts
  - Component Factor Effects charts
  - RBC Transfusions charts (both standard and LOESS analysis)

## Active Decisions

Several key technical and design decisions are guiding current development:

1. **Client-Side Processing**: All data transformation and visualization happens in the browser, with no server-side processing
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between dashboard control, data loading, and visualization components
3. **Premium Design System**: Modern, accessible interface with dark/light theme support
4. **CSV as Data Source**: Standardized data format with specific naming conventions and structure

## Documentation Updates

- **Component Factors Module Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation in `componentFactorsModule.md` that explains:
  - How Table 2b is generated and integrated into the Main Findings tab
  - The dual-purpose nature of the Component Factors module
  - Implementation details of the small multiples visualization technique
  - CSS styling for the Component Factors visualization
  - Code structure and potential areas for refactoring

## Next Steps

Based on the project documentation and recent work, logical next steps appear to be:

1. **Further Visualization Refinement**: Additional enhancements to chart capabilities and interactivity
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient data processing for larger datasets
3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Robust handling of edge cases in data loading and processing
4. **Export Functionality**: Ensuring high-quality SVG export for research publications works well in both themes
5. **Additional Theme Improvements**: Review other UI elements for potential dark mode enhancement
6. **Responsive Design Implementation**: Ensuring proper function across different device sizes
7. **User Testing**: Validating the improved dark mode interface with target users
8. **Code Refactoring**: Consider refactoring duplicated utilities (like `getParameterDetails()`) into shared modules

## Open Questions

As I begin working with this project, several questions will need clarification:

1. What is the current development priority among the different modules?
2. Are there specific visualization features that need enhancement?
3. What is the current testing approach for the application?
4. Are there known issues or limitations in the current implementation?
5. What are the deployment plans for the dashboard?

## Development Approach

The development approach appears to follow these principles:

1. **Modular Implementation**: Each functional area is developed as a separate module
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, with advanced features added incrementally
3. **Design System Compliance**: UI elements follow the established design system
4. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling for data loading and processing
5. **Scientific Accuracy**: Visualizations prioritize accuracy and clarity for medical research

As I work with this project, this active context will be updated to reflect the evolving focus, recent changes, and emerging priorities.
